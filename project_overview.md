# Graduate Admission Prediction System - Problem Definition

What is graduate admission prediction?
A system that uses machine learning to estimate the probability of a student being admitted to a graduate program based on their academic profile and application materials.

Why is this prediction useful for students?

Helps students assess their competitiveness for specific programs
Allows students to identify areas of improvement before applying
Assists in making strategic decisions about where to apply
Reduces uncertainty in the application process

Specific outputs our system will provide:

Probability of admission (quantitative estimate)
Explanation of which factors are helping or hurting chances
Personalized recommendations for improving application
SOP quality assessment

How this differs from a simple calculator:

Uses machine learning rather than fixed formulas
Provides explainable AI to help understand the prediction
Offers personalized recommendations based on individual profiles
Incorporates qualitative factors like SOP quality
Adapts to patterns in the data that might not be obvious
